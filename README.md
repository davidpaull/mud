# mud

Fairly simple mud client - which will bind to local IP and port 5001\
If wanting to run on publicly accessible IP, simply change 127.0.0.1\
start_game.py variable ip_addr and/or port and open that port in IPTables.

Should work out of the box, obviously needs some world design as there's only 4-5 rooms at current

# TODO

Need to add an NPC class - essentially mirroring a player, but give some type of pathing\
keep announce logic, etc.\
eventually to add health pools to this and combat ability, etc\
corpse, despawn, respawn check and timers, etc...

Feel free to use logic and / or code or help build this world, TODO's, etc
