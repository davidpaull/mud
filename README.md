# mud

Fairly simple mud client - which will bind to local IP and port 5001\
Should work out of the box, obviously needs some world design as there's only 4-5 rooms at current\
To run on public IP, edit variable ip_addr in start_game.py and port as you want

# TODO

Need to add an NPC class - essentially mirroring a player, but give some type of pathing\
keep announce logic, etc.\
eventually to add health pools to this and combat ability, etc\
corpse, despawn, respawn check and timers, etc...

Feel free to use logic and / or code or help build this world, TODO's, etc
